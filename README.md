So this is the C# code, project and solution for XRY test automation.
The solution uses Appium in conjuction with WinAppDriver from Microsoft to drive the XRY ui and manipulate it.

To run the use need:
* Visual studio community 2015 or later.
* Install WINAPPDRIVER from here https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases.

XRY must be running before starting the script and the same goes for winappdriver.exe.
